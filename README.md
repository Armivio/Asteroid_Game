# Asteroid_Game
A very basic game in which you control a ship and try to avoid collision with asteroids. You can shoot the asteroids to get rid of them, but some may split into smaller ones!
Initially made in the boot.dev course "Build Asteroids".

Things to be added (outside the scope of the course):
- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
